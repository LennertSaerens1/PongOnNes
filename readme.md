# About the Project
We are the NerdSquad, and our mission is to create Pong for the NES.

This project is a collaborative effort by Karel Roelandt, Bram Sprenger, Lennert Saerens, and Thymme Mouchrique. During development, we utilized Visual Studio and the MesenX emulator to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.
