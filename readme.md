# About the Project
We are the NerdSquad, and our mission is to create Pong for the NES.

This project is a collaborative effort by Karel Roelandt, Bram Sprenger, Lennert Saerens, and Thymme Mouchrique. During development, we utilized Visual Studio and the MesenX emulator to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.

# Instructions to Build and Debug the Project

### Prerequisites
- Alchemy65 (for Visual Studio Code integration)
- CC65 (for compiling assembly)
- Mesen/MesenX emulator (for testing)
- Visual Studio Code (for development and debugging)

### Using Visual Studio Code with Debugger to Edit and Debug (Requires Alchemy65 Installed):
Open the project folder in Visual Studio.
- Locate and open the pong.s file.
- Press Shift + Ctrl + B to build the project. Alternatively, select Run â†’ Start Debugging.
Ensure the launch.json file is configured correctly to point to your mesen.exe.

### Building Outside Visual Studio:
* Simply execute the build_outside_vs.bat script.
* Run the resulting .nes file located in the debug folder.
